# A slow loris implementation in Rust

This project is basically simply a learning project for me to learn Rust, and
is a perhaps functional slow loris implementation.

## OMG you're doing it wrong

Since this is my first Rust project I am very likely to do something wrong. I
would be very, very interested to learn about it, and ways to make the program
better or more "rustic".

Please reach out if you find something that could be made better!
